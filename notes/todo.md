# TODO for this template

- bind the `Version` attribute of the `config` struct to the `version` flag on the root command
- basic GHA workflows for testing (w coverage?) and deploying (make->zip->tag->release)
- how to keep this updated with the latest in logrus, cobra/viper, and Go version? is renovate sufficient?
